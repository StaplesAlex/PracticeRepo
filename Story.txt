# If the player chooses to move on, the next place is randomised with different things to do.

# Drinking at the bar causes the player to become drunk and awake in a random place within the town at a random time. Deducts money.

# Staying overnight starts the monster raid mission. Completion awards a level.

# The mercenary mission makes the player go on a small expedition to a cave to stop the monster raids. Completion awards money.

## The player can talk to different people in the town to get a variety of side missions for them to complete. Awards less money than the main missions.
